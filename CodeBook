# UCIHARS Code Book
Code Book for Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera Assignment

-  'CodeBook.md' is a code book that describes the variables, the data, and transformations to clean up the data

Variables:
=========================================
This data set has the following variables;
-activity; a set of characters that describe one of 6 activities undertaken by subjects in the experiement;
"Walking", ,"Walking upstairs","Walking downstairs","sitting","standing","laying"

-subject; an integer used to represent the different subjects who performed the experiment

-mean and standard deviation of signals measured in the original experiment

Data:
=========================================
A desciription of original data used to conduct this analysis is available at:
http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones

The original dataset can be obtained at:
https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip

This code combines the files provided above into a single labelled file and extracts all mean and standard deviation vectors.
This code uses the dplyr package to summarised data provides the mean value of each activity and subject group in the original dataset.

Transformations:
=========================================
This code uses rbind() and cbind() to combine original data into a single dataframe.
grep() is used to extract only standard deviation and mean values.
sub() and gsub() functions are used to provide readable labels to the dataframe.
The select() and summarize_all() functions in the dplyr package are used to average mean and standard deviation.
